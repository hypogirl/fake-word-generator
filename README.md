# Fake Word Generator
Essentially, what this generator aims to do is to randomly generate fake words that "look" and "sound" like it belongs to a specific language you select.
For now, it's still in a very early stage with only two languages: Portuguese and Russian. Most of the time, it won't generate a decent word.

### What this generator already does:
  * Creates words by putting syllables together considering how often they appear in a language
  * Know what possible syllable and letter mixing there are and not allow impossible words to be generated

### What I want this generator to do in the future:
  * Add prefixes and suffixes already existing in a language
  * Consider the right position for a certain syllable
