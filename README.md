# Fake Word Generator
Essentially, what this generator aims to do is to randomly generate fake words that "look" and "sound" like it belongs to a specific language you select.

(Note: It seems to work better for 5-7 character words.)

### What this generator does so far:
  * Creates words by mixing syllables together considering how often they appear in a language;
  * Knows what syllable and letter mixing is possible and doesn't allow impossible words to be generated;
  * Add prefixes and suffixes already existing in a language;
  * Consider the right position for a certain syllable (still testing this one).

### Languages properly studied so far:
  * Portuguese
  * Russian
