# Fake Word Generator
Essentially, what this generator aims to do is to randomly generate fake words that "look" and "sound" like it belongs to a specific language you select.

(Note: It seems to work better for 5-7 character words.)

### What this generator already does:
  * Creates words by mixing syllables together considering how often they appear in a language;
  * Knows what possible syllable and letter mixing is possible and doesn't allow impossible words to be generated (not 100% working yet);
  * Add prefixes and suffixes already existing in a language.

### What I want this generator to do in the future:
  * Consider the right position for a certain syllable (almost covered)
